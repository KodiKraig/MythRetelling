Odysseus
Listen my dear wife, we have successfully evicted the suitors from our palace and I must go and refill our supply that has been depleted by the suitors during my absence. First of all, Telemachus, the herdsman, and I will go to see my father. You must stay here till I return.

Penelope
All I ask is that you come back home to me after you have completed your mission and that you will never leave me again. I will stay here and keep an eye on the palace while your gone.

Odysseus
Everyone grab your armor and prepare to move out. Telemachus, stay close to me and be brave. You have done an excellent job with the suitors and you have made your father very proud. Athena will allow us to move in secrecy so that we may make it through town without being seen.

Odysseus
Go inside the main house and kill the fattest pig for dinner. I will go to the garden and talk to my father to see if he still knows me considering my long absence.

Odysseus
Hello father, it has been too long but I am finally back to take my rightful place here in Ithaca. It brings a happiness that is so strong it is unexplainable to be able to see your face again. I was often worried I would never make it back here or that you wouldn’t remember me.

Laertes
Oh Odysseus, a father never forgets his son no matter how long a separation keeps us apart. My how dear Penelope and Telemachus have missed your presence. I am sure they are more than happy to have you back as am I. Come, lets go up to the house and continue our talk.

Laertes
Odysseus, I assume you have dealt with the suitors already. I fear that an attack in the near future from the Ithacans may be inevitable. Many of the suitors you have slain have their family here and are probably not going to be very happy when they find their children or friends have been killed.

Athena
Father Zeus, what are we to do with Odysseus and the opposing Ithacans? Odysseus had every right to rid his palace of the suitors for they have spent countless days and nights in his home gobbling up all his wealth and disrespecting him while he was gone.

Zeus
Well my child, last time I checked I am the one in charge. So your going to wipe all their minds and then they will act like nothing happened. Simple as that. Im tired of hearing about them. I have better things to do with my time.

Athena
But father, we do this all the time to the mortals. Don’t you think it is a bit immoral?

Zeus
Immoral? Have you forgotten who you are talking to child? I run everything around here and this is how we are going to do it. I couldn’t care less about being immoral. I call the shots and no one can say different.

Odysseus
Everyone look out the window! The men are coming up over that hill in the distance. We must prepare for battle!

Laertes
I might be old but I still have it in me! I too will arm and join you in the battle, I have dreamt of this day! Just because my son and grandson are a few years younger than I, don’t underestimate an old man!

Athena
You are my favorite Laertes and always have been. I helped bring Odysseus back here partially for you and I am not about to let all of our hard work go to waste. I have a plan so do not fear! You will strike first blood. Throw your spear now!

Laertes
As you wish goddess! I will take out that one in the front wearing a bronze helmet. I bet you I can hit him in the head!

Athena
Ok Laertes, I was just trying to give you a self confidence boost, I wasn’t planning on you actually killing one of them! So everyone stop and listen up or I will kill you all before you can even lift a finger!

Odysseus
Alright Athena, we are listening what is it you have to say.

Athena
This is what we are going to do. I am going to wipe all your minds clean of this battle and you all shall return home as if nothing as changed. Since my father and I are in charge, we decide what you people get to fight about and this is not going to be a fight. Goodnight everyone.
